# fantasy game implementation

Fantasy game for Toptal project

## Getting started

1. docker build -f devops/base/Dockerfile . -t fantasy_base_image:latest

2. docker-compose up --build

3. Actually, we can do one more interview, and I can tell you how endpoints work here. 

4. Warning: I did not test the project well. Because Toptal did not require that. But I send you a piece of another project where you can see my test coding.
